v2 dapp:
- [ChatGPT]Brainstorming.html: make routing/components work (get rid of blank page issue)
- 43160 characters max for updating an Fullarticle
- {ipfs-cid-lenght} characters max for the Partialarticle text field

v2.1? try to implement a upgrade introducing the option to reference a UTF-8 HEX tx in addition to IPFS CID, so work as a hybrid between Partial and Full

eternal-journalism-v3:
- articles as POAP-like (Soulbound) NFTs, with option to set a cover img to each article (reference IPFS CID or reference a tx of base64/svg)
- ensure contract is upgradeable and can change version (v3.1, v3.2, etc)
- integrate articles from v1 and v2
- go multichain pave the way to use oracles to prevent duplicates
