# Eternal Journalism

A dapp that enable journalists to protect their articles "forever" (thanks to the blockchain and/or IPFS technology - unless Ethereum really implement "The Purge" the way I think), so information can't be censored.

This is also a protest to Ethereum's possible plans for "The Purge".

You have two modes when saving an article: Partial or Full.

In the Partial mode, you use an IPFS CID to store the article; in Full mode, the plain text is saved on the blockchain.

## Deployments

On Polygon, the gas cost is ~$3 per Full article depending on its size. For Partial it should be less than ~$1.

Not deployed to Ethereum, yet.
