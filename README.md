# Eternal Journalism

A dapp that enable journalists to protect their articles forever (thanks to the blockchain technology and/or IPFS), so information can't be censored.

You have two modes when saving an article: Partial or Full.

In the Partial mode, you use an IPFS CID to store the article; in Full mode, the plain text is saved on the blockchain.

## Deployments

On Polygon, the gas cost is ~3 per article depending on its size.

Not deployed to Ethereum, yet.
