# Eternal Journalism

A dapp that enable journalists to protect their articles forever (thanks to the blockchain technology and/or IPFS), so information can't be censored.

This is also a protest to Ethereum's possible plans for "The Purge".

You have two modes when saving an article: Partial or Full.

In the Partial mode, you use an IPFS CID to store the article; in Full mode, the plain text is saved on the blockchain.
